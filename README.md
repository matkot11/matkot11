# Hi, it's me🙍‍♂️

I code for as long as I can remember. My journey with coding started with Arduino and when I realised I love coding I have started looking what best fits me and as a result I ended up with Frontend. I am learning that for almost two years and still love it. That's why I went to England to study computer science in order to further my knowledge in coding. I am currently in my first year and besides my studies I would like to get experience in work.
